# convEncoder
Encoder decoder for trellis based convolutional codes.

Given the transition graph associated to a convolutional codes and the transition probability over a BSC channel simulate the whole pipeline of encoding - streaming - decoding.

Homework for the exam "Code Theory and Structure of Convolutional Codes" which I sit at Politecnico di Torino during yy 2010-2011.
